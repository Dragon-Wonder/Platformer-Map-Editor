## Resources Folder

This folder holds resources that are used by the program. 

Currently it holds the Icon I use for the program, as well as the boilerplate which hold infomation about the program that can be seen in the complied .exe

## Icon Credit

Credit for the Icon I use goes to [PelFusion] (http://www.pelfusion.com/).

You can find the orginal [Here](http://www.iconarchive.com/show/long-shadow-media-icons-by-pelfusion/Maps-Pin-Place-icon.html).

No changes have been made to the file and it is being used under the license [CC Attribution 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

You can really use whatever ico file you want if you complie the program yourself, just put it in the resource folder called "Icon_App.ico" (If you are using my complie script).
